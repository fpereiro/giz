> "You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself." --Ken Thompson

giz is a bunch of auth functions. Eventually this library will provide enough auth code to develop a production ready web application.

giz is very much a work in progress. Feedback is very welcome (fpereiro@gmail.com).
